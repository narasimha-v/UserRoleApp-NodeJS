# UserRoleApp-NodeJS

Task 1
Making the first user who registers, as Admin.
● The code should be well structured
● Must have proper comments
● Should document the workflow and how to run the code
Description :
There should be two models Users and User_Roles.
First time when user registers, the User_Roles table should contain value as admin for that user
and for rest of them it should be different.

Start server using npm run dev to start on localhost:3000 in non Production Mode

Sample o/p tested using Postman:

{
    "role": "basic",
    "_id": "5e1380f20a734737d47f1bdd",
    "user": {
        "_id": "5e1380f20a734737d47f1bdc",
        "username": "test9",
        "__v": 0
    },

}
